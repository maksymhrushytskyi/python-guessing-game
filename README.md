# 🎯 Guess the Number — You vs Bot

A simple Python game where you compete with a smart bot to guess a hidden number.  
The first to guess it correctly — **wins**!

## 🧠 How It Works

- The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
- You and the bot take turns guessing.
- After each guess, a hint is provided:
  - `Too low`
  - `Too high`
- The bot uses smart guessing (binary search strategy).
- The game ends when someone guesses the correct number.

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Run the script:

```bash
python game.py
